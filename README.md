# Agents-SDK
OpenAI Agents SDK
- The OpenAI Agents SDK enables you to build agentic AI apps in a lightweight, easy-to-use package with very few abstractions.
- It's a production-ready upgrade of our previous experimentation for agents, Swarm.
- The Agents SDK has a very small set of primitives:
    - **Agents** , which are LLMs equipped with instructions and tools
    - **Handoffs**, which allow agents to delegate to other agents for specific tasks
    - **Guardrails**, which enable the inputs to agents to be validated
